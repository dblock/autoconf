                               Release notes.

I have finally finished both of the converters, AUTOCONF into DOS Multiconf
and vice-versa. This has been tough, since structural conversion algorithms
between DOS's circular multiconf construction and AUTOCONF's linear
structure were pretty complicated. Anyway, these have been written in one
week of hard work, so just enjoy.

These converters apply on CONFIG.SYS file only! The difference with DOS's
AUTOEXEC.BAT and AUTOCONF's is the CONF variable (CONFIG for DOS). Consequent
chages should be made for AUTOEXEC manually, since a converter is far from
being ready.

If you need details for these converters or any help for multiconf structures,

History:

Version 1.0, 1.1a, 1.1b
ออออออออออออออออออออออออ

        First release of ACF2DOS & DOS2ACF, revisions (a) and (b).

Version 1.10
ออออออออออออ

        Modifications after consequent problems in the DOS2ACF logic.
        
        Modifications to lower/uppercase construction of written lines.

        SET xxx line correctly treated.
        ;xxx lines correctly treated.
        REM lines correctly treated (false suppression of spaces removed).

Version 1.11
ออออออออออออ

        Colors in the configuration names are cleaned with ACF2DOS.

Version 1.20
ออออออออออออ

        Major bugs corrected.
        Default configuration is checked.
        Bad CONFIG.SYS structure is shown.

Version 1.30
ออออออออออออ

        Important bugs corrected in the structural construction in both
        DOS2ACF and ACF2DOS.

        In general: support for AUTOEXEC.BAT has been added:

        ACF2DOS constructs configurations compatible AUTOCONF for
        AUTOEXEC.BAT.
        ACF2DOS modifies %CONF jumps into %CONFIG jumps, thus making 
        AUTOEXEC fully compatible DOS. Designations are modifie in CONFIG.SYS
        only to a full vector of the name, since AUTOEXEC's structure for
        AUTOCONF contains unique designations only:
                F1
                F1_A (etc...)

        DOS2ACF modifies jumps %CONFIG to %CONF making AUTOEXEC.BAT
        100% compatible AUTOCONF. The designations are verified between
        AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS.

UNRF 1.0
ออออออออ

        UNRF changes the references created by QEMM into their real values.
        Works on DOS multiconf configurations only!

        Explanation: QEMM's OPTIMIZE run with DOS multiconf creats a ref
        file, called LOADHI.RF containing all real values of the references 
        for memory managing.
        This is done not to make your CONFIG.SYS too heavy.
        Before, QEMM put these references directly into the CONFIG.SYS,
        that is what UNRF does.
        So you can reconvert your CONFIG.SYS into AUTOCONF format and enjoy
        the full power of QEMM.

UNRF 1.01
อออออออออ

        Checks that the CONFIG.SYS is really a DOS multiconf structure.

Version 1.31
ออออออออออออ

        modifications for consequent compatibility with AUTOCONF 2.90

Version 1.32, 1.40
ออออออออออออออออออ

        consequent bug corrections
